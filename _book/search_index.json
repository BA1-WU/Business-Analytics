Another interesting case is that of binary outcomes, i.e. when the variable we want to model can only take two values (yes or no, group 1 or group 2, dead or alive, etc.). In this case we can technically still use a linear model, however the predictions it will produce will most likely not be particularly useful. Consider the following simulated data Figure 12.1: The same binary data explained by two models; A linear probabilty model (on the left) and a logistic regression model "]
